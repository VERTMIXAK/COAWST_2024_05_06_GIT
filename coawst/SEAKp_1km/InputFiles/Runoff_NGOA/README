Steps for creating a ROMS rivers file from this runoff file

ROMS SIDE PREP

1. First, the maskedge program needs to be run on the ROMS grid file.
It produces a list of the i,j pairs along the edge of the land mask.
Save it in a file and edit out the parts of the land mask you don't
want included (here, i<209). Call this file maskedge.out.

    python maskedge.py $ARCHIVE/gridpak/Cook_inlet/NWGOA_grid_3.nc > maskedge.out
STDERR:  New body! 1 1
STDERR:  There are 1  bodies of water.

2. Run the add_rivers program to create the ROMS file of i,j river
locations:

    python add_rivers.py NWGOA3_rivers.nc

add_rivers.py can have a cycle_length of 365.25. Removed here.

HILL AND BEAMER SIDE PREP

4. The new file format is coast cells only. With help from Fred,
I got the thing working in the test_regrid.ipynb notebook, straight
onto the ROMS grid.

    python test_regrid.py

runoff_raw is to any ROMS point, then runoff is to coastal points
only. Needs get_littoral2, a slight change to get_littoral.

6b. (optional) This is to split some big rivers to flow into more than
one grid box. (not used in this domain)

    python hack_runoff_clim.py

7. Phase two onto the ROMS rivers file:

    python make_river_clim.py

Like add_rivers, this has been hacked for an annual cycle.
Also to fix a units problem (ROMS wants m^3/sec).

8. This can be dangerous! You want all years to have the same number of rivers,
not true in the arctic with JRA, so I'm not doing it any more. Put this before tracers:

    python squeeze_rivers.py NWGOA_rivers.nc squeeze.nc
    mv squeeze.nc NWGOA_rivers.nc

9. Then there's the tracers... Seth gave me one year of daily values to
be reused year after year. We need a second, cyclic river_time.
Plus we need to hack ROMS to accept only one value per day - the new
ONE_TRACER_SOURCE flag.

    python add_temp.py NWGOA_rivers.nc
    python set_temp.py NWGOA_rivers.nc

Not sure why this latter is needed, but it is for now.

10. Finally, setting Vshape:

    python set_vshape.py NWGOA_rivers.nc

11. If using dyes:

    python add_dye.py

12. Then there's the BGC stuff in /import/archive/u1/uaf/kate/NWGOA3/Rivers

CHANGING THE LAND MASK

If one changes the ROMS land mask, not all the steps need to be repeated.
You do need to rerun steps 1 and 2. [The remapping files change.]
Half of step 10a needs to be redone (runoff_raw to runoff), but you
can redo all of step 10a or edit that script. Then steps 11, 12, 13 all
need to be redone, making sure that steps 10b and 13 have the correct
river locations.

OTHER YEARS (out of date)

1. Copy an empty NWGOA_rivers_xxx.nc file to the years needed.
2. Run "python mask_flow.py" on discharge file, hacking leap years as needed.
3. "python make_runoff_clim.py" to get gridded ROMS file.
4. "python hack_runoff_clim.py" to change big rivers.
5. "python make_river_clim.py" to fill ROMS river file from step 1.
6. "python add_temp.py NWGOA_rivers_1998_1999.nc"
7. "python set_vshape.py NWGOA_rivers_2000_2001.nc"

8. "python add_dye.py" if using dyes.
